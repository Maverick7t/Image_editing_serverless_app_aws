## How to Add Your Images

1. **Replace placeholder images** with your actual screenshots:
   - `before.jpg` - Screenshot or scan of your planning/sketch phase
   - `after.png` - Screenshot of your live application

2. **Supported formats**: 
   - JPG/JPEG for photos and screenshots
   - PNG for diagrams and graphics
   - WebP for optimized web delivery

3. **Recommended sizes**:
   - Width: 800-1200px for optimal display
   - Height: 600-900px
   - File size: Under 1MB for fast loading

## Usage in README

The main README.md references these images:
```markdown
![Before - Architecture Sketch](images/before.jpg)
![After - Live Application](images/after.png)
```

Replace the image files while keeping the filenames the same, and the README will automatically display your new images.
